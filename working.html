<h3>Working With the Hydropower Program in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Offce. The Hydropower Program at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Water Power Technologies Offce (WPTO) supports research, development, demonstration, and commercial 
activities to:</h3>
<h4> <ol type="disc">
<li>• Advance transformative, 
cost-effective, reliable, and 
environmentally sustainable 
hydropower and pumped storage 
hydropower technologies. 
</li>
<li>•Better understand and capitalize on

<h3>Hydropower Benefits</h3>
<p>Hydropower has provided the United States 
sustainable, reliable, and affordable power for over 100 years. In 2020, it accounted for 
more than 7% of U.S.electricity generation and nearly 37% of U.S. renewable electricity generation.<br> Hydropower, including pumped storage hydropower, provides flexibility, inertia,storage, and grid services to support the integration of variable renewables, like wind energy and solar power.</p>
<p>Pumped storage hydropower is the largest 
contributor to U.S. energy storage with an installed capacity of 21.9 gigawatts, 
or roughly 93% of all utility-scale energy 
storage capacity in the United States. <br>
Additionally, pumped storage hydropower 
offers unique flexibility and long-duration 
storage, and multiple new large-scale 
pumped storage hydropower projects have 
started development. </p>

<p>Even though many technologies used in 
hydropower today are well established 
and commercially available, there is still 
opportunity for innovation and growth. 
DOE’s Hydropower Vision report found 
that an additional 50–65 gigawatts of 
new hydropower and pumped storage 
hydropower could be added to the U.S. 
generation mix by 2050.<br> However, to 
realize this potential, difficult scientific 
challenges facing the existing hydropower 
fleet must be addressed and new 
technologies must be developed to reduce 
the costs and environmental impacts of new projects. </p>
